<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermochromic Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Thermochromic Materials</li><li>Irreversible Thermochromic Materials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thermochromic materials market is divided into two main types: reversible and irreversible thermochromic materials. Reversible thermochromic materials can change color with temperature fluctuations and revert to their original state once the temperature stabilizes, making them ideal for applications like temperature-sensitive packaging and clothing. In contrast, irreversible thermochromic materials permanently change color when exposed to certain temperatures and do not revert, often used in indicators for temperature exposure in products and safety applications.</p></p>
