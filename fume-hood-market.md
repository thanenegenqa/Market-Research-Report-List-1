<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fume hood market is primarily categorized into two types: ductless fume hoods and ducted fume hoods. Ductless fume hoods filter and recirculate air within the laboratory, utilizing built-in carbon or HEPA filters, making them versatile and easy to install. In contrast, ducted fume hoods vent hazardous fumes directly outside through ventilation systems, offering superior safety for handling volatile substances. Both types serve critical roles in ensuring the safety of laboratory environments by controlling hazardous emissions.</p></p>
